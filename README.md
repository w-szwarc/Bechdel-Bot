# [Bechdel-Bot](https://github.com/NLP-UG-2021-22/PaprykarzSzczecinski-Project)

This web app allows users to interact with a chat bot in order to determine whether particular movies pass the Bechdel Test, ask about the plot, score, and more.
It has been conducted in collaboration with [Lara Lejderman](https://github.com/Aellai) and [Oliwia Ko≈Çecka](https://github.com/okliwia).
